XRDL aims to be a comprehensive solution to the inherently error prone 
process of writing XML-RPC clients in various languages. I currently maintain 
XML-RPC client classes in C++, php, actionscript 3, C# and javascript, so I 
have a fairly strong interest in automating client generation.

XRDL is intended to be simple, as most people seem to choose XML-RPC for its
simplicity.

XRLD is currently in its infancy, but as XML-RPC is basically the data 
transfer protocol that we use throughout our architecture, I expect that 
additional work will go into XRDL, to save time in the long run.
