XRDL was born as a pet project of mine at work, in an attempt to simplify 
working with XML-RPC clients and servers.

It is currently in its infancy, but as XML-RPC is basically the data 
transfer protocol that we use throughout our architecture, I expect that 
additional work will go into XRDL, to save time in the long run.
